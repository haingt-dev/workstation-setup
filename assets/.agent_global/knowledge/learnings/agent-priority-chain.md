# Agent Priority Chain: Claude → Antigravity → Kilo

**Tags**: #agents #workflow #roi #tokens

## Learning
Not all AI agents are equal for all tasks. Using the right agent for the right job optimizes:
- Token usage (cost)
- Response quality
- Development speed
- Context window efficiency

## Priority Chain
**Claude > Antigravity > Kilo**

### When to Use Claude (Primary)
✅ **Best For**:
- Complex analysis and planning
- Deep architectural discussions
- Cross-project work
- Large context window needs
- Interactive coding sessions
- Tasks requiring Memory Bank context

❌ **Overkill For**:
- Simple typo fixes
- Single-line changes
- Quick refactoring

**Why Primary**: Best context integration, highest capability, token-optimized with auto memory.

### When to Use Antigravity (Secondary)
✅ **Best For**:
- UI-based workflows
- Quick edits with visual feedback
- Tasks where UI is more convenient than CLI
- Gemini-specific features
- When Claude is busy/unavailable

**Why Secondary**: Good UI, different model (Gemini), but less integrated with our Agent Global Hub.

### When to Use Kilo (Tertiary)
✅ **Best For**:
- VS Code integrated workflows
- Quick in-editor refactoring
- File operations within IDE
- When you're already in VS Code

**Why Tertiary**: Editor-native experience, but context integration not as tight as Claude.

## ROI Analysis

### Token Cost Optimization
- **Claude**: High per-token cost, but auto memory + Memory Bank = fewer tokens wasted
- **Antigravity**: Different pricing (Gemini), can be more economical for simple tasks
- **Kilo**: VS Code integration sometimes more efficient for editor tasks

### Time Optimization
- **Complex tasks**: Claude saves time with better understanding
- **Simple tasks**: Kilo might be faster (no context switching)
- **UI tasks**: Antigravity visual feedback helpful

## Decision Tree
```
Task Complexity?
├─ Complex/Ambiguous
│  └─ Use Claude
│
├─ Medium (Clear requirements)
│  ├─ Prefer UI?
│  │  └─ Use Antigravity
│  └─ Prefer CLI/Already in VS Code?
│     ├─ In VS Code → Use Kilo
│     └─ Terminal → Use Claude
│
└─ Simple (One-liner, typo, etc.)
   └─ Use whatever is open
```

## Practical Examples

### Claude Scenarios
```bash
# Planning new feature
cd ~/Projects/Wildtide
claude
> "Load Memory Bank. Plan implementation for multiplayer system"

# Cross-project refactoring
cd ~/Projects
claude
> "Review authentication patterns across all projects"

# Complex debugging
cd ~/Projects/media-server
claude
> "Analyze performance issue. Check Memory Bank for known bottlenecks"
```

### Antigravity Scenarios
- Quick doc edits with preview
- UI-based code generation
- Visual diff review

### Kilo Scenarios
- Rename variable across files (VS Code refactor)
- Quick function extraction
- In-editor code completion

## Metrics to Track
- Time spent per task type per agent
- Token usage per agent
- Task success rate per agent
- Context loss frequency

## Evolution
This priority may change as:
- Agents improve
- New features added
- Pricing changes
- Personal preferences evolve
